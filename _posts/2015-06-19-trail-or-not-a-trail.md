*Getting some ground truth in the villages.*

As we try to find the ideal route for the Transcaucasian Trail, we’ve been looking at a lot of maps, but our many hours spent studying does not always lead finding a route.  The reality on the maps is very different from the reality on the ground. The old Soviet maps are (sometimes deliberately) inaccurate and out-of-date, and many of the trails recent maps that are theoretically designed for hikers in Georgia don’t exist. Some of them do, but they haven’t been maintained in a long time and have totally fallen apart to the point that they are impassable. So everywhere we go, we’ve basically just been stopping random people on the side of the road to ask them if they know of any trails up to the mountains, to the next village, anything. Talking to one local person for 10 minutes has easily as helpful as looking at a map for hours.

One unexpected source of help in eastern Georgia has been the border guards that we seem to run into at the end of each river valley. We were able to get through some initial suspicion (the “flying camera” in the back seat of the car didn’t help), and we got permission to explore the valleys that lead up toward the border. While we expected the border guards to take an interest in our activities, we didn’t expect so much assistance.

*A very helpful border guard in Lopota Gorge.*

Two of them even accompanied me (“for your protection”) on horseback for a 6 hour hike to show me the way up to the border from the village of Uzuntala. It was tough going (for me and the horses), but the soldiers seemed to enjoy the break from the routine, stopping to collect mushrooms in the forest, asking about what trees/fruits/plants grow in America:

“Do you have walnut trees in America?”

“Yes.”

“Do you have apples?”

“Yes.”

“Do you have hazlenuts?”

“I think so…”

“Do you have cherry trees?”

“Mmm hmm…”

Eventually, I told them I had never seen tqemali (sour plums) in America. This seemed to satisfy them.

As the two were enjoying a few cigarettes at the top of the ridge, gazing at the valley below, one of them said, “Man, I don’t want to go back down.” I agreed. Unfortunately, they had told me to leave my camera down at the border station, so I tried to take a mental snapshot as we prepared to head back.

Over the next few days, our reputation preceded us. We ran into the border guards in Lopota gorge a few days later, and his initial skepticism melted away after a call to his superiors. “You’re the Americans? The cartographer and the teacher? Where are you trying to go?”
