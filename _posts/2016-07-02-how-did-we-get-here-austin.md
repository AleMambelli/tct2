title: How Did We Get Here?  Austin.
---
I just a kid when I first moved to Georgia for the Peace Corps.  I’d traveled growing up, but the experience of learning a new language and being immersed in a different culture immediately overwhelmed me. [COULD BE MORE SPECIFIC HERE – GIVE SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE] After the first month, I was so stricken with homesickness that I packed my bags and put them by the door of my bedroom. I remember long afternoons staring at those bags, thinking about the course my life might take.  Returning to Oklahoma meant comfort, familiarity.  Staying in Georgia meant marching into the unknown, a daunting if thrilling prospect. These weren’t decisions I’d ever had to make before, and I didn’t know what to do.

My host family must have sensed it, or maybe they just saw the bags one day when I was out because the next day, they invited my friend over for a big dinner in the hopes of cheering me up. [BUILD SCENE UP MORE] After a few glasses of wine, my host mother jumped up from the table and started playing a lively waltz on the piano.  My host father, a goofy and gregarious man, took my friend by the hand, and led her around the living room, a funny sight considering how much taller he was than her.  Somewhere in that moment, as I was laughing and clapping to the music, I realized that going back home meant foregoing so many more memories like these I had yet to form.  Since then, I’ve come to think of that moment as the root of my entire life, every new friend and experience a branch growing from it.
