*The misty forests of Lagodekhi National Park*

I was very excited to start hiking this week in Lagodekhi National Park, one of my favorite spots in Georgia (fair warning: you might be hearing that a lot from me this summer). The park protects a gorgeous corner of far eastern Georgia on the border with Azerbaijan. From the fertile lowlands, where every yard is bursting with roses, grapes, and kiwis, the mountains rise straight up to 3000 meters (about 10,000 feet). Because it was a protected area for much of the 20th century, the park has very healthy forests in addition to its alpine lakes and meadows. The terrain makes for incredible (if demanding) hiking. 

And I had a great hiking partner! We met Matt in Tbilisi and he joined the TCT team eager to head east and see what adventures we could find.

We thought that because eastern Georgia is generally drier than the west we might run into less snow and be able to make more progress mapping the higher portions of our route. Matt and I were full of energy and enthusiasm as we started out, and we quickly climbed from the lush valleys up through the clouds toward the Russian border. We were able to make it to 2700 meters on the first day, when ran into our first snowfields. We had been sweating our way uphill through the summer heat for hours, but now we were back in winter. The rangers had warned us at the beginning of the hike that there would be snow, but we hadn’t realized just how much was still up there. 

It was already late, so we made camp and decided to see how far we could get the next day. As we watched the sunset, a full moon rose over the plains of Kakheti below. The temperature dropped and a blanket of clouds suddenly appeared below us. We eyed some giant storm clouds on the horizon, crossed our fingers that they weren’t headed our way, and settled in for the night.

After a windy but dry night we got up in the morning and set out across the snowfields. Immediately, we realized how difficult it would be to make it to our next goal, Black Rock Lake at 2800 meters. We’d take 5 or 6 careful steps with the snow holding our weight and then suddenly the next step would break through the top crust and we’d be thigh-deep in wet snow. It was rough going, and we stuck with it for a couple of hours, staying on ridges to avoid the biggest snowfields. But as we reached a plateau and could see the giant snowfields between us and the lake, we knew that spending hours slogging toward the lake was foolish. We had to turn back and wait for summer to finally come to the highlands of eastern Georgia. If only I had my skis!
