Consulting local communities about a tourism-related activity that affects them is one of the main pillars of sustainable tourism, and I am convinced that there are many readers of this blog who know “why bother” to engage. However, I have been asked that question many times over while preparing our community consultation visit in Svaneti, which begins today. So I will try to supress my overwhelming excitement for a few minutes and explain why we bother. 

We are heading to the mountainous villages in Svaneti, surrounded by 3-5,000 high peaks of the Caucasus, to consult on the TCT development before the start of the trail building work there in July. As far as we are aware, this is the first ever tourism-related project in Georgia that has community engagement at its core. 

So maybe because nobody has properly engaged with the local communities before, I have been asked by some Georgians: “but why? why do you care?”. I have even heard: “just do what you need to do and tell them what to do and they will listen”. 

Er… Really? 

We are going to talk to the Svans – proud, traditional, respectful of and living in wonderful harmony with the often harsh natural environment around them. We have nothing but respect for the way they have managed to preserve their unique culture, customs, tradition, language and architecture. It is their home and their land, and nobody has the right to intervene without their consent. We also need to make sure that the TCT is not going to disappear in a few years because of lack of care and neglect, which has happened to many trails in Georgia before. So, first of all, **we are going to Svaneti to get the locals’ blessing, trust, approval and support for the TCT** before we start building it. 

The local people will be the ones most affected by the TCT, and we hope to explain and discuss the benefits the Trail can bring to them and to their community, but also listen to any concerns, suggestions, objections. Also, would they want to be involved, and how? Can they help with trail building and maintenance? 

We believe that having a hiking trail that will become an internationally-recognisable brand will bring more people to the region. But any increase in tourism requires adjustments in tourism management, **so we want to find out what skills they think they need to be able to fully benefit from the TCT and to manage the increase number of visitors.** Do they feel prepared for such increase? Do they worry about anything? Perhaps they say they need some English language training, or some financial support to improve their guesthouses, or some training to help them better understand tourists’ needs and expectations? We don’t know yet – and are going to find out.

I have also heard that “there are hikers coming already, there are trails – why do you want to create another trail”? 

Anyone who has tried to hike in the Caucasus will admit that it can be an “adventurous” experience that requires some skills and stamina to enjoy. There are trails but they aren’t clearly marked, maps are poor, some sections are dangerous to pass or involve questionable fun such as a forest of two-metre high stinging nettles. The most adventurous hikers get lost and sometimes hurt. And there is no reliable rescue service in place so the local people have been called to help, which also throws a lot of responsibility onto their shoulders. 

So the TCT will make hiking in the Caucasus safer and more accessible to everyone, but **we will need the local knowledge to discuss the proposed route to ensure it will benefit both hikers and the local people.** In addition, many people come to Svaneti for a day and, without much to do, leave and don’t come back. What can the local community offer tourists to encourage them to stay longer and recommend it to others? Maybe they already have ideas to improve their service, but don’t know how to implement them? Again, we hope to find that out. 

We know how little we know. There are also many things we know that they don’t know. But there are also things we both know and that’s why we are going to meet, explain, listen, discuss and learn from each other. I am sure that the findings will be fascinating - but that’s a topic for my next blog.
