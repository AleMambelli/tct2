*A waterfall in the Nenskra Valley - totally off the trekking radar.*

Jeff and I came out to Svaneti in western Georgia to map what we think will be one of the most spectacular sections of the TCT. Our goal for the route was to connect the villages of the region starting as far west as we could.  So we drove up the first valley north on the way up to the mountains to see what we could find.

We saw a trail marked on the old Soviet maps from the village of Tita to Nakra over Utviri Pass. It turned out to be a spectacular hike that is very little visited by trekkers in Georgia, but promises to be another highlight of the TCT.

*Tita is in the Nenskra valley, a spectacular, forested valley full of waterfalls, rushing rivers and rustic villages.*

The western part of Svaneti feels different from the much more visited eastern part. It doesn’t have the ancient ruins and towers, but makes up for it with spectacular raw natural beauty. From Tita, the trail goes over Utviri Pass providing great views of the range that separates Svaneti from Abkhazia. There was still a lot of snow on the pass, so it was slow going, but I made it over to the Nakra valley by early afternoon.

On the way down, I could see across the Enguri valley to the south and to Mount Ushba to the north. As I came into the valley, I passed one of the most dramatically situated shepherd camps I have seen. It was still a couple weeks before the shepherds (cowherds more likely) bring animals up to the high camps, so I didn’t meet any of them. In fact, I didn’t see anyone the entire day. Two whole valleys to myself!
