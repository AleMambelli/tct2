After a stormy night camping out in the Nakra valley, I continued east through the villages of western Svaneti. The high route west from Nakra would be inaccessible to anyone but the most experienced hikers and mountaineers, so we are planning a lower, but no less spectacular route. 

One really cool aspect of hiking through Svaneti is that it is usually possible to make it to the next village in a day, so with a clear, well-maintained trail, future thru-hikers will be able to choose between the alpine sunsets and starry nights spent camping in the mountains or traveling light and experiencing hospitality of local guesthouses. My recommendation: do both!

The path east from Nakra turned out to be an old jeep track through the woods. A relatively easy climb took me over a low pass and within a few hours, I was in the village of Tsaleri. I passed medieval churches, unassuming from the outside, but which contain treasures of medieval Christianity, and the first Svan towers I had seen, unique structures built by clans in the middle ages to protect themselves from invaders and each other.

Many of these villages have been slowly abandoned over the past few decades, but a few families in each village keep them alive, making a living from the land as they have for centuries (of course, the televisions and cell phones make the nights a little less boring/more boring, depending on your perspective.)

After passing through Tsaleri, I followed what looked like the best path toward the next village. An afternoon storm rolled in, and the jeep track I had been following turned into a footpath as I descended toward the river that runs between the two villages. I started to lose the trail, bushwhacking through stinging nettle until I found it again only to lose it a few minutes later. The rain was falling a little harder, the trail getting fainter, until… nothing. I realized I was lost. I could see the next village through the trees, but as I pushed through the undergrowth and climbed over fallen trees, I came to sheer drop-off covered in ferns, leading straight down to a small gorge. No way I was making it across that. I climbed back up the hill and fumbled through my pack for my trusty old Nokia phone to see if I could reach Jeff, who was going to try to make it over to the village via the road and collect some local intelligence on the trails. 

Luckily, Jeff had already made it there and had met Valera, a local, who would turn out to be my savior. Valera assured Jeff there was a bridge across the river. I described my location and the two of them figured out where I must have gone wrong. A few kilometers back, I had missed a small footpath off the jeep track that leads down to a bridge. 

I backtracked to the village, and after some searching I found the path, obvious if you know what your are looking for, but hardly visible if you don’t. A steep path led back to the gorge, and I had my doubts about this supposed bridge, but then after a sharp turn, there it was, and Valera, too! He had hiked down through the rain to make sure I made it out of the canyon and up to the village.

*I found Jeff waiting by the fire…*

Valera and his family welcomed us into their home, and I was able to warm up and dry off by the fire. With in a half an hour, a meal had been prepared, and Valera was making toasts to us in the grand tradition of hospitality in the Caucasus. 

We talked about the history of villages in the area, where Valera was born some 60 years ago. The neighboring village had been abandoned about ten years ago when the last family left, and Valera and his wife are the sole remaining inhabitants of Kichkhuldashi. His children and grandchildren had moved to Tbilisi. As we ate, we asked Valera why he had chosen to stay in the village when so many of his neighbors and family had left. Did he not like city life? He said he liked it alright, but life in the village was so much easier; he has his pigs and cows and garden and bees. “Here, I’m rich!” he said with a laugh. I had never tasted honeycomb so delicious, so I saw his point.

The skies cleared in the afternoon, and I decided to set off for the next village. Assured by Valera that it was just a half an hour away.

I found the route easily and followed it through another ancient but abandoned village and down toward the river, but when I got there, there was no bridge! The villagers had put some logs across, but the water was so high from snowmelt and the recent storm, that it was rushing over the rudimentary crossing.

*The “bridge” I was looking for.*

I thought about it for a while, but decided that crossing wasn’t worth the risk. I’d have to backtrack again. I followed another path down to the main road. It was a long walk down, but I was enjoying the afternoon light and the fields of wildflowers. As I got closer to the road, a farmer approached me and asked me where I was coming from and where I was going. I explained that I had been up at Kichkhuldashi (”Oh, at Valera’s place?”) and that I was trying to get to Gheshderi, but there wasn’t a bridge.

He gave me a concerned look and pulled out his mobile phone. After a long conversation in Svan, the local language, he hung up and looked at me.

“If we built a bridge right now, would you still want to go to Gheshderi?”

I was dumbstruck for a few moments by the offer. I looked back up the valley I had just come down.

“Um… You know, that’s ok. I think I’m good.”

He laughed and invited me to his place for a drink, but I had already had my fill, so I thanked him again and headed down the hill to find Jeff.
