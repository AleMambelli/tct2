The plan for developing the TCT is always changing - whether because of high snow, sensitive border areas, or our own confidence in finding existing trails. One of the major issues we faced at the start was my broken foot - well, not broken exactly, but a slight bone fracture that’s left me hobbling around in a stiff shoe for a couple of months.

While Paul and other TCT enthusiasts are up in the mountains exploring trails, mapping routes, and better understanding the lay of the land, I’ve been relegated to a different and hopefully equally important role in the foothills. Providing support at the trailheads with our trusty Pajero, I spend my days gathering local information, creating maps, and studying all the possible routes that the trail might take. I record the hefty amount of notes and GPS points that Paul collects, and add the information to our self-designed maps. They’ve started calling me *Data*.

We’ve now shifted our attention to the Svaneti-Racha segment of the trail, which promises to be one of the most breathtaking. In planning it helps that there are already a healthy amount of hikers in some of these parts during the summer, and so some routes are already mapped, and in some cases even marked.

With each segment of the trail we study all of the available information, consider what already exists, and ask ourselves: what would the ideal Transcaucasian Trail look like through this region? There is a good tug and pull between Paul’s preference for the most highland routes possible and my preference for directing the trail through tiny, charming villages. In the end this results in planning trail segments that have a great mix of both. Still, we try to explore all the possibilities so that the exact trail can be discussed and determined with partners later on.

The hiking is key, but it’s the data that will move the TCT forward. Where should the trail run? What are the big challenges? Where are bridges needed, paths cut through the weeds?

There is more information about crossing Svaneti and Racha than about other segments, though it is by no means an easy hike. In Svaneti there are three passes to cross between our start point in the Nenskra valley and Ushguli, the highest village in Europe and the end point of the Svanetian segment. Beyond Svaneti is another major pass, and three days of near wilderness to cross into Racha. This will be the most challenging piece, and likely also one of the most stunning.

*A rough sketch of our route across Svaneti and Racha*

Looking at Svaneti and Racha it all looks pretty straightforward, but it’s not. The maps we have are rough to say the least. Too many times the maps we’ve taken from the tourism office or from local companies have led us astray, and so we’ve recognized the need for really reliable, accurate maps.

For this reason we’ve created our own - they aren’t necessarily more reliable - but at least we know what is and is not reliable information. The topography and land cover is easy, and having this can help us find valleys, ridges, and so forth. But the trails are often a best guess, which is one of the reasons we want to map as many of them as possible. Our maps have black trails - these are trails which come from OpenStreetMap, have been mapped recently, and should be fairly accurate. We also have red trails - these are trails copied from Soviet maps from the late 1980s - that are rarely still there, or if they are, they are much more likely to dead-end at some point.

*Existing trails, possibly existing trails, and plenty of room for new trails to map*

Venturing out and planning a potential TCT route is a monumental task, made all the more challenging by poor maps and trails that are occasionally mis-marked or poorly maintained. We’ve met numerous hikers already who have similar problems as us - getting lost. All together this reaffirms how important it is to establish great trails, provide solid information, and make hiking the Caucasus an even more rewarding experience.
