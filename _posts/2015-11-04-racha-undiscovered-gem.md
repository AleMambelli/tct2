When I managed to get the last week of October off work, I decided to go back to my beloved Georgia for the fourth time, and explore one of the regions on the Transcaucasian Trail – Racha. Tucked between the mountains of Svanetii and the northern bits of South Ossetia,  Racha is - according to a promotional brochure I’ve picked up in Tbilisi - “a special, completely unspoiled and beautiful place high in the mountains, boasting a landscape of mountain forests and high alpine meadows.”

I have also read that Racha’s divine wine, Khvanchkara (apparently Stalin’s favourite) “doesn’t travel well” and it is best to taste it locally. Did I need a more appealing invitation? Accompanied by my friend Giorgi, I set off for a new adventure.

The Wine
--------

Although Racha is less than 300 km away from Tbilisi, travelling on windy roads and crossing two mountain passes took about six hours (but the views were breathtaking). The first thing we saw when we entered Ambrolauri was a huge monument dedicated to …. Khvanchkara , one of the most popular Georgian wines.

The semi-sweet, raspberry-flavoured red wine (best drunk chilled) is one of the best wines I have ever tasted. It is expensive (a bottle costs about £20), but it is very unique: produced only from the Alexandrouli and Mudzhuretuli grape varieties cultivated in only one village in the world, near Ambrolauri.

We knocked on the door of the Khvanchkara factory in Ambrolauri and were given a free private tour (and generous wine tasting) by the friendly manager. I was also given a litre of Khvanchkara as a gift.

The Culture
-----------

We then headed another 25 km east to Oni. Oni is fascinating – a small and quiet town surrounded by the mighty Caucasus, with an overwhelming feeling of tranquillity. You naturally slow down here -there seem to be no reason to rush. Now I understand why the people of Racha have the reputation across Georgia of being late for everything!

All locals we’ve met were very welcoming and hospitable - well, I’m not surprised because this is Georgia -but I was feeling even more welcome here than anywhere else. We stayed at the Gallery hotel, a small place built and run by friendly local artists, Elene and Temuri. They run art workshops for local kids as well as a local painting school.

We were offered an enormous amount of food and home-made wine before looking around the stylish house, filled with Elene’s paintings and all wooden furniture made by Temuri.

Temuri insisted we visit the Ethnological Museum. It was shut, but two managers walked from the other side of town to open it just for us and we enjoyed another spontaneous private tour.  And it was well-worth a visit. The small museum houses several collections of artefacts found locally, dating back to the Stone Age, and including many architectural details from 10th century local churches as well as an impressive collection of 20th century paintings from the region.

Back in the Gallery hotel, we joined a group of Ukrainian guests dancing, singing and drinking while being taught by Elene how to make some regional delicacies: khachapuri (bread filled with cheese), churchkhela (nuts in hot grape juice), shkmeruli (chicken in garlic) and chacha (strong grape vodka). The party, with the food we made and a lot of wine and chacha, went on till 3am. Although I have experienced it many times, the Georgian hospitality amazed me once again.

Temuri’s home-made chacha-making equipment is pretty impressive:

The Mountains
-------------

We visited a tiny mountain village of Glola, about 25km east of Oni. Absolutely beautiful in the autumn colours and nearly deserted, made us feel as if time has stopped a few decades ago. The beautiful mountains of Racha and its tiny and picturesque villages deserve a separate blog post. I will only add a couple of photos to encourage you to check our blog again in the near future.
