*How high does it fly? How far does it go? Can you get it in Tbilisi?*

Drones seem to gather a crowd. In fact I may have met everyone in Svaneti now, thanks to our friendly flying camera. Kids jump up and down or stare in wonder. 

*Daddy! Why did it go away?!*

Some of the older women have worried about it - they don’t want their pictures taken. The men all ask the same curious questions, even the one who thought I was a Russian spy. Twice it has inspired shepherds with its potential for watching cows in the mountains.

I keep making the same mistake - leaving it uncovered in the car when driving near border areas. It tends to make the military police a little suspicious. 

*Oh, that’s just my flying camera*, I say with my most touristic American face. *For taking pictures!*

And that’s what it’s for. No, I can’t watch cows, deliver food, grab it with my hands and go flying. Technology today is just too limited.

*“Coptie” does get some good shots though*

Five years ago I had the privilege of working with [JumpStart International](http://jumpstart.ge/), who implemented a community-based mapping project across Georgia. Jeff Warren of [Grassroots Mapping](http://grassrootsmapping.org/2010/07/largest-balloon-map-so-far-in-mestia-georgia/) and [Public Laboratory](http://publiclab.org/) was here, and together they flew balloons with cameras attached. The most impressive photos came from Mestia, the main town in Svaneti. If you look at [Google Satellite today in Mestia](https://www.google.com/maps/@43.0437801,42.725282,1200m/data=!3m1!1e3), you’ll see photos that were not taken by a plane or satellite, but by a balloon filled with hot air.

Five years later and with a flying camera in my hands, I couldn’t resist the opportunity to replicate this feat, albeit with a different technology. 

The technicals of it are perhaps not so interesting - I set up a few automated missions for the copter, which then flew in a gridlike pattern over Mestia at an altitude of 200 meters, snapping photos along the way. Unlike a balloon, the drone has a quite limited flight time, so numerous launches were necessary.

The resulting images came out nicely, and after [stitching them together](http://mapknitter.org/maps/mestia-2015#) it was possible to compare. Mestia is quite an interesting study - for a small mountain town a lot has changed in five years. Not long after the first balloon mapping, the government of Georgia resolved to promote tourism in the region, in large part by renovating parts of the town, particularly around the central square.

Coptie wasn’t able to cover quite as much ground, but I was impressed that I could get such great images with a copter not particularly suited for taking aerial photographs.

For any fellow geodorks, you can explore the changes yourself [on this page](http://jeffhaack.github.io/mestia.html). A hearty thanks to Public Laboratory for their awesome tools and Google for pulling the balloon images into their maps. And the biggest gratitude to the people in and around Mestia for their interest, excitement, and of course their hospitality.
