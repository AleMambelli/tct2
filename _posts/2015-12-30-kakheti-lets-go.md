The efforts to attract people, who might at least guess what language is used above, are starting to pay off. I have a short story to tell you why, but let’s get back to the language first. It is Georgian – one of the 14 unique alphabets existing worldwide today. “If you were not smart enough in geography, then it’s high time to open the Google Maps application!” - that’s what the ‘weird’ looking sentence on the top suggests. And if you follow the above challenge, I would also suggest typing “Kakheti” in the ‘directions’ line and start exploring…

Kakheti is only a two hour drive away from the capital Tbilisi, and has a lot to offer to visitors not only in the hot summer months. Every time I visit this part of Georgia, I add at least an extra hour to my travel plans as there is so much to experience. Culture, history, tradition, excellent wine and, of course, hiking – Kakheti has it all (not many people know, but the breathtaking Tusheti National Park is part of the Kakheti municipality, but I will talk more about hiking at the end of this post).

Donkeys and wine
----------------

Don’t be surprised by the number of donkeys you see on your trip through Kakheti – the region is famous for them. But with vineyards on every corner, Kakheti is mostly known for being [the home](http://georgianwine.gov.ge/eng/text/124/) of Georgian wine, best to visit in the autumn.

When vintage starts, in  mid-September to early-October, you will hardly find a family who doesn’t press grapes. Visitors are always welcome to join in and help, and it’s a lot of fun if done in a traditional way - in a Satsnakheli (winepress). Then the grape must (badagi) is poured into a qvevri, a large clay amphora-like vessel that is traditionally buried in the ground up to its neck, in which wine is fermented and stored. This centuries-old wine-making method is still used all over Georgia, although most often in the eastern region of Kakheti, Qvevri is included in the list of [UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/07/20/whats-in-a-qvevri-georgias-intangible-cultural-heritage).

Palaces and festivals
---------------------

Kakheti is rich in cultural heritage sites. You can find all kind of tourist attractions in this region – old towers, half-ruined historic fortresses, churches dating back to the 5th, 7th, 12th, 16th centuries, museums with ancient artifacts, and even the palace of the King Erekle II in Telavi, considered the best-preserved medieval royal palace in Georgia. Please don’t expect the latter to look like the Versailles or like the Palacio Real of Madrid, as some of my European friends did. Georgian kings spent most of their time fighting enemies, and the country was never rich enough to afford that kind of luxury.

If you are interested in locally produced wine, honey, cheese, handicrafts, visit the annual New Nadimi festival held in the Telavi’s Nadikvari Park in October.  You can join locals celebrating Erekleoba – the Kings Day on 7th of November, when Telavi becomes a truly different place, hosting open air concerts, exhibitions of famous artists and photographers, and of course – more wine tasting opportunities. If you want to run for charity, the Wings for Life World Run is held in Kakheti every year on the first Sunday of May.

Anyone for hiking?
------------------

Now that you have drank enough wine and seen the cultural heritage, it is time for hiking! As mentioned earlier, the breathtaking Tusheti National Park and high-mountain villages like Omalo, Dartlo and Juta are part of the Kakheti municipality.  They are there for you between May-October (depending on weather conditions). I’d rather write a separate post about this marvelous part of the region, as it’s hard to be brief in sharing the emotional experience from my visit last summer. Since we will be building and marking the Transcaucasian Trail in Tusheti next summer, you will surely hear more about Kakheti and Tusheti. 

As a teenager, I used to find various school trips to Kakheti boring (too much history ☺),  but in the last few years I started appreciating my homeland’s yet unexplored potential in a different way. Now, when I’m back home, I feel lucky for being born in Georgia. Take Kakheti - one region (out of so many great ones) with so much to offer to any type of tourist, and all year long. 

So… Kakheti? Tusheti? Let’s go!
