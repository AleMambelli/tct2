Although developing a hiking trail across the Caucasus has been on our minds for quite a while - we had been making plans in our heads, discussing ideas and potential routes with friends and local guides, trying to assess the potential support from the local people, studying various maps, drawing hypothetical Transcaucasian Trail routes and scouting bits of the future TCT – we formally launched the TCT project three months ago, at the beginning of November 2015. 

And we have been pretty busy since then, building connections and partnerships with a variety of stakeholders, promoting the project locally (in the region) and internationally, setting up the TCTA (its team and strategy) and making tangible plans for the TCT building this summer. 

Here are the main activities we would like to update you on:

- We have agreed with the [National Hiking Federation](https://www.facebook.com/molashkre) (NHF) in Georgia to form a partnership which should be finalized in the next few weeks. We have the same goals to make hiking in the region safer and more accessible for everyone, to benefit the local communities and to protect the region’s rich cultural and natural heritage. This is also exciting because the NHF incorporates about 80 hiking clubs throughout Georgia and their undeniable local knowledge, experience and passion for hiking will contribute significantly to the development of the TCT.

- We have gained [formal support for the TCT](https://www.facebook.com/transcaucasiantrail/photos/a.642688115862544.1073741829.624354204362602/775427375921950/?type=3&theater) from the Embassy of Georgia to the UK and are working with the [Georgian National Tourism Administration](http://gnta.ge/) (GNTA) to formalize the GNTA’s support for our project.

- We have spoken about the TCT at two tourism-focused events in the UK: “The Georgia Days” in October, organized annually by the University of Westminster, and CATBIG (business network of companies focusing on the countries of Central Asia and the Trans-Caucasus) in December. Our presentations were attended by a variety of stakeholders, such as the Georgian Embassy staff including the Ambassador Revaz Gachechiladze, a range of academics from the UK and Georgia, travel agencies operating in the Caucasus, local travel bloggers and journalists, the British Georgian Society and some of its best well-known hikers such as Peter Nasmyth or Tony Anderson, and a wide number of business representatives from the region.

- We aligned our plans in accordance with the [Georgia tourism strategy](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/12/07/a-tourism-strategy-for-georgia-new-path-ahead) 2015-2025, recently developed by the Government of Georgia with support from the World Bank Group (WBG).

- We attended the “WBG Tourism Forum 2015: Driving Development Through Tourism” in December where the World Bank President Kim highlighted the role of sustainable tourism in Georgia. We met with the WBG experts to communicate our idea and get some initial feedback. We are pleased to say that we have their informal endorsement allowing us to use some of the WB’s resources such as research, data, local knowledge and expertise related to the Regional Development Projects in the Caucasus region. 

- Our media portfolio is growing – we will add links to the TCT-related articles onto our website soon. We were pleased when der Spiegel, one of Europe's largest weekly news magazines mentioned the "thrilling” Transcaucasian Trail as one of [top hiking challenges for 2016](http://www.spiegel.de/reise/aktuell/wander-urlaub-die-besten-tipps-fuer-2016-a-1070619.html)! 

- We have reached stakeholders in Armenia too, and are pleased to announce that the whole of the TCT’s Southern Route in Armenia will be scouted by us over the next few months, in preparation for the TCT marking and mapping in 2017.

- Building the community support for TCT: we have been preparing a thorough consultation with the local communities and other local stakeholders (such as guides, travel businesses, NGOs, local parks and protected areas) that will take place this Spring in Svaneti and Tusheti in Georgia. Keep an eye on our FB page to learn more!

- Also, an important bit of admin: we have registered as a non-profit organization, the Transcaucasian Trail Association (TCTA), that has a mixture of local and international team members. We operate in five different time zones and speak eight languages between us, but have the same passion for hiking, for the Caucasus and its people that can move mountains ☺

So … a lot of preparing, promoting, connecting, building foundations, but now we are all set up and ready for the most exciting bit: trail building! If you want to get involved in building the first two sections of the TCT, please get it touch for more details! Visit our [volunteer page](http://transcaucasiantrail.org/en/get-involved/) to find out more, or [contact us](http://transcaucasiantrail.org/en/contact/) directly.

See you on the Trail!
