After sitting through several dismal days of rain in Mestia, I quite literally sprung out of bed this morning when a sliver of sunlight breached the curtain.  The sky had opened, and I couldn’t get ready fast enough.  Austin, being far more low-maintenance than I, required only a quick shake and he was ready to go.

This was day one of my summer activity – writing a guidebook to the TCT route across Svaneti and Racha.  Austin, our summer volunteer manager, joined to help explore the route that begins in Mestia and leads to a group of villages known collectively as Mulakhi.  

![image01][]

In total there will be 14 legs to the Svaneti-Racha route, with each leg covering a distance that can be hiked in less than a day.  Some of the hikes, like our trip today, are already popular among visitors to Svaneti.  They are already marked, and ready to be incorporated and connected into the Transcaucasian Trail.

We went *velosipedit*, as they say in Georgia, by bicycle.  I already knew that most of the route was a wide dirt track, with relatively little elevation change, and so I figured we’d speed it up a little bit and have some great mountain biking opportunities.

I was immediately impressed by how well the trail was marked – red and white painted stripes keeping us on course as we pressed up the southern ridge of the Mestiachala River Valley.  The scent of azaleas embraced us and led us gently forward.

To our left the towering peaks of the Greater Caucasus beckoned.  The twin peaks of Ushba, which look like a pair of horns, refused to blow away the mist and say hello.  Ushba is one of the great mountains of this region, as is Tetnuldi, which sits majestically further to the east.

It is said that Ushba and Tetnuldi are coy lovers who are always playing a game of hide and seek.  This is meant to be representative of the weather here in Svaneti, where the two “lovers” are so often covered in clouds, that they can rarely be seen at the same time.

The track carried on with a gentle incline, and we greeted numerous trekkers from Russia, Germany, and Czech Republic.  It dawned on us that we were actually slower with the bicycles than we would have been on foot, as group after group of hikers passed by.  This was primarily due to my stopping every 10 meters to take a photo and some notes, but at one point we reached a 200 meter stretch that was incredibly steep, and we had to slowly plod upwards, carrying our bikes.

This was the only such stretch, however, and reaching the top at about 1900 meters, the track led us to a magnificent sprawling field.  How on earth could we have forgotten our Frisbee!  When I come across such a soft, lush field, I wish I could make myself a giant and lay down, stretching my limbs into the warm grass.

Here there is quite a lot of space to run around and explore.  A trail leads through the grass up the Tskheki Creek towards a glacier, and there are fantastic views all around.  Despite our meager human-sized status, we lay ourselves down in the grass and soaked up the sun.

Upon continuing, things became more challenging with the bikes.  We came across several long stretches with ankle deep mud, and more than once we sunk in beyond the top of our shoes.  Not only did this making the going much less enjoyable, but it also prevented us from cycling any great distance, though of course, we should have simply gone on foot.  But even so, for such a lovely hike it detracts that there are such lengthy stretches when you sink into the earth.  It reminded me of one of the key elements of trail-building, to build so that the trail easily sheds water and does not become a glut of mud.

We carried on over the ridge, plodding slowly through muddy sections, with the occasional ride in between.  Beyond a large marsh we at long last came to the top of the Mulakhi Valley in all its magnificence.

This is where we had to make a decision.  The marked trail cuts off of the track and becomes a footpath, meandering on the north edge of the valley and overlooking the many villages below.  Meanwhile the track continues down to the first village in the valley, and various tracks and paths connect the 11 villages that make up the community of Mulakhi.

From the start of the valley, dotted with beautiful Svan towers and quaint farms, the trail must reach the end of the valley, one way or another, before a more difficult hike over a pass to Adishi.  Trekkers must decide whether they want the “natural route” or the “cultural route,” a choice which invariably affects the hikers themselves and the inhabitants of the villages.

On one hand, there is a lovely path that is already marked, which branches off of the vehicle track and wanders calmly above the valley, offering views over the charming towers below and the imposing mountains beyond.  It brings the trekker through a couple of villages, eventually leading to Zhabeshi, the last village before the next day’s ascent.

It is also possible to descend on the dirt track to the first village, Zardlashi, before walking village to village down the center of the valley.  Indeed, the existing trail markings where these trails split is not entirely clear, and it seems that numerous hikers descend this way already, without immediately realizing their mistake.

These two possible routes may not matter all that much to the typical hiker, but there are a couple of significant differences.  From the point of view of the hiker, the difference is between a hike that remains slightly more natural versus a route that is more culturally immersive.  And for sure some hikers prefer one over the other.  From the point of view of the villages, it is a difference between tourists coming through their village (and potentially spending money), and tourists not coming at all.

The latter point is something we are keenly aware of, as the self-proclaimed designers of an epic trail network.  During our community consultations the past weeks, we have learned how people feel disenfranchised when trekkers are routed to a specific village.  Why, they ask, should everybody stay in the guesthouse in the village where the trail leads, rather than the guesthouse in the village a few hundred meters away?

From my perspective, they make a valid point.  Ideally the benefits of tourism should be allowed to spread as evenly as possible, otherwise there may be few benefits at all, if it results in conflicts between those well positioned and those who are not.

On the other hand, it is impossible to route a trail through every village, and improbable that trekkers won’t lodge in a location that is not most convenient for them.

So then, what to do?  It occurs to me that the best solution might to be to mark and improve both routes, and offer them both as the equally impressive attractions that they are.  Then trekkers can decide which route to take and leave it to the business savvy of locals to ensure that a few dollars are left behind. 

Austin and I, we took the cultural route, because we really like the feeling of small villages and the generally welcoming people who live in such places.  Midway through the valley, we split up – whilst I was able to quench my thirst at the home of a villager, Austin found the cleverly located “Beer Bar” in Cholashi, no doubt an attraction for all the hot and tired hikers at the end of a long day.
