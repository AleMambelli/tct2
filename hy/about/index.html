description: The Transcaucasian Trail (TCT) is a proposed hiking path across the Caucasus Mountains from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea. A branch of the trail will head south from the Greater Caucasus range to the Lesser Caucasus. The trail will connect 17 distinct regions, where over a dozen different languages are spoken, across one of the most biologically diverse regions of the world.

                <p>Our vision is a world-class, long-distance hiking trail that crosses the Greater and Lesser Caucasus and connects diverse communities and ecosystems, providing lasting and wide-ranging benefits for people and the environment.</p></br>

                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>Our mission is to develop, promote, and maintain the Transcaucasian Trail in order to improve access to the regionâ€™s diverse cultural and natural heritage and encourage its  preservation, benefiting local communities and trail users through the development of sustainable tourism.</p>

                <h3>Building a World-Class Route</h3>
                <p>Over the next five years, the Transcaucasian Trail (TCT) project aims to develop a world-class, long-distance trail network across the Caucasus, linking roughly two dozen existing and proposed national parks in the region. The network will consist of two intersecting trail corridors, each roughly 1500 km long. One corridor, oriented east to west, will connect the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, and the other, oriented north to south, will connect the Greater Caucasus and the Lesser Caucasus. </p>
    
                <p>These well-marked and well-maintained trails will provide a world-class experience for hikers and other trail users, while increasing economic opportunities for local communities. The TCT will improve access to historic sites and protected areas in the region and raise their profile, helping to ensure that the natural and cultural heritage of the Caucasus can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>
    
                <p>The trails will be built in several phases, each phase focusing on trails in specific regions. As these regional trails are completed, they will be connected to each other to form the long-distance corridors. Ultimately, visitors will be able to walk these trails uninterrupted for hundreds of kilometers.</p>

                <h3>Crossing Cultures</h3>
                <p>Many sections of this trail already exist. These trails, crossing the great valleys and passes of the Caucasus, have been used for centuries by local communities, shepherds and explorers to get from village to village in the mountains. Unfortunately, large parts of the trail network throughout the Caucasus have deteriorated in recent years and although existing trails may be known to locals, they are not easily followed by visitors.</p>

                <p>Completing the TCT will require mapping the existing sections and coordinating improvements and maintenance, including clearing undergrowth and fallen trees, relocating eroded trails, building bridges and improving signage. As the trails are improved, new trails will be created to connect existing sections. The final goal is to have a continuous uninterrupted trail that is well marked and maintained, making the most spectacular areas of the Caucasus accessible to all hikers.</p>

                <h3>Who We Are</h3>
                <!-- <p>We are a growing community of interested hikers, mappers, conservationists and supporters who want to improve the hiking opportunities in the Caucasus for locals and tourists alike. So far we have mapped hundreds of kilometers of trail that will become a part of a long-distance hiking network. As the trail is mapped, we will be producing hiking guides for the region and planning trail improvement activities.</p> -->

                <p>The Transcaucasian Trail Association (TCTA) is a non-profit organization based in Washington, DC, with team members in London, Yerevan, and Tbilisi. Our team members have many years of experience in the region and deep, grassroots connections with our affiliate organizations, local communities along the trail, and relevant national and local authorities in the region. The TCTA will serve as the central coordinating body for trail development and promotion, building the necessary partnerships with individuals, communities, NGOs, academics, businesses, and governments, and laying the groundwork for successful trail development.</p>
