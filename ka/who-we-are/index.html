description: We are a growing community of interested hikers, mappers, conservationists and supporters who want to improve the hiking opportunities in the Caucasus for locals and tourists alike. So far we have mapped hundreds of kilometers of trail that will become a part of a long-distance hiking network. As the trail is mapped, we will be producing hiking guides for the region and planning trail improvement activities.
