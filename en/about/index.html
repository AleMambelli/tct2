description: The Transcaucasian Trail (TCT) is a proposed hiking path across the Caucasus Mountains from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea. A branch of the trail will head south from the Greater Caucasus range to the Lesser Caucasus. The trail will connect 17 distinct regions, where over a dozen different languages are spoken, across one of the most biologically diverse regions of the world.

                <h3>Our Vision</h3>
                <p>Our vision is a world-class, long-distance hiking trail that crosses the Greater and Lesser Caucasus and connects diverse communities and ecosystems, providing lasting and wide-ranging benefits for people and the environment.</p></br>

                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>Our mission is to develop, promote, and maintain the Transcaucasian Trail in order to improve access to the region’s diverse cultural and natural heritage and encourage its  preservation, benefiting local communities and trail users through the development of sustainable tourism.</p>

                <h3>Who We Are</h3>
                <p>We are a growing community of interested hikers, mappers, conservationists and supporters who want to improve the hiking opportunities in the Caucasus for locals and tourists alike. So far we have mapped hundreds of kilometers of trail that will become a part of a long-distance hiking network. As the trail is mapped, we will be producing hiking guides for the region and planning trail improvement activities.</p>

                <h3>Building a World-Class Route</h3>
                <p>The Transcaucasian Trail (TCT) is a proposed hiking path across the Caucasus Mountains from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea. A branch of the trail will head south from the Greater Caucasus range to the Lesser Caucasus. The trail will connect 17 distinct regions, where over a dozen different languages are spoken, across one of the most biologically diverse regions of the world.</p>

                <p>The region is home to stunning natural landscapes and unique historical sites, yet many of these incredible assets are inaccessible, threatened by environmental degradation and neglect.</p>

                <p>Establishing a world-class hiking route across the Caucasus will encourage sustainable tourism and development in remote areas, support the preservation of the region’s rich cultural heritage, and raise the profile of its protected areas. The trail will help build connections between communities, ecosystems, and people, in a place where there is too much focus on the things that divide.</p>

                <h3>Crossing Cultures</h3>
                <p>Many sections of this trail already exist. These trails, crossing the great valleys and passes of the Caucasus, have been used for centuries by local communities, shepherds and explorers to get from village to village in the mountains. Unfortunately, large parts of the trail network throughout the Caucasus have deteriorated in recent years and although existing trails may be known to locals, they are not easily followed by visitors.</p>

                <p>Completing the TCT will require mapping the existing sections and coordinating improvements and maintenance, including clearing undergrowth and fallen trees, relocating eroded trails, building bridges and improving signage. As the trails are improved, new trails will be created to connect existing sections. The final goal is to have a continuous uninterrupted trail that is well marked and maintained, making the most spectacular areas of the Caucasus accessible to all hikers.</p>
