description: The Transcaucasian Trail is the greatest hiking route you’ve never heard of. The Caucasus, on the border of Europe and Asia, is one of the most biologically and culturally diverse mountain ranges in the world, but one that few have had the chance to explore. Now our growing community of hikers, cartographers and conservationists is putting this hidden gem on the map to help ensure that the natural and cultural heritage of the region can be enjoyed by future generations.

                <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
                <h2>And Answers</h2></br>
                <h3>Is it dangerous to hike in the Caucasus?</h3>
                <p>Hiking in the Caucasus entails many of the same risks that hikers find anywhere in the world. Some parts of the TCT travel through areas that require knowledge and experience of hiking in high-alpine environments. If you don’t have that experience, we recommend hiring a guide. In general, the security situation in the mountains south of the Russian border has improved greatly over the past decade but that situation can change quickly. It is always advisable to check any government travel warnings prior to travel.</p>
                <br/>
                <h3>Can I wander across the borders in the mountains?</h3>
                <p>No, you must only cross borders at official crossings. Crossing borders anywhere else will lead to serious complications. Some maps for planned trails on this website do not show the recognized border crossings. It is also important to note that some borders in the region are not recognized or agreed upon by all parties. It is your responsibility to make sure you are not illegally crossing any borders. In the future, we will have more resources on this website for planning trips in the region. </p>

                <h3>Can you hike the whole TCT?</h3>
                <p>Right now, several hundred kilometers of trail exist. There are spectacular treks through the regions of Svaneti, Racha, Mtianeti, Khevsureti, Tusheti, Lagodekhi National Park, Borjomi National Park, and Dilijan National Park. Trying to connect any of these established routes is not advisable at this point.</p>
                <br/>
                <h3>How will you build a trail in a region with breakaway territories and frozen conflicts?</h3>
                <p>It won’t be easy and it may take many years but we believe it is possible. People have crossed these mountains for centuries and we hope it will become easier to cross certain areas in the decades ahead. By starting to build a trail we would like to help spur more positive and ambitious approaches. In the meantime, there are hundreds of kilometers of trail to hike. See you in the mountains!</p>
