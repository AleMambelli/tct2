                    <p>Summer is approaching quickly, and we are seeking international volunteers to help us with the tough work of building the Transcaucasian Trail. The work will involve blazing trails, building tread way, putting up signs, building bridges, and other manual labor. So if you want to work hard, have fun, and contribute to a worthwhile cause, we want you! We will provide a fun but no-frills experience for those interested in taking on the challenging and rewarding work that will support the creation of the trail. Get ready to make new friends, enjoy the beautiful mountain scenery, and learn about the Caucasus, trail building, and conservation. And work hard! Did we mention that already? :-) If you are interested in joining us in July or August, please read the details and the download the volunteer application here:</p>

                    <p>Are you planning to hike in the Caucasus? Do you like exploring new, unexplored trails? If so, we could use your help.</p>

                    <p>Part of designing the best Transcaucasian Trail possible is exploring and mapping the thousands of routes that may or may not exist - such as those that are unmapped or may have existed in the past but are now grown over. We need (and fellow hikers also need) information about these trails. When do we turn right instead of left? Where can we get water? Where are the good camping spots? By documenting new routes, you can help us plan the TCT while also providing valuable information to the growing body of hikers in the region.</p>

                    <p>If you are planning to hike in the Caucasus, we want your knowledge! Visit the link below to learn more about mapping your hikes, collecting helpful information, and writing trail descriptions for others to follow.</p>

                    <p>And one more thing: if you want to help explore new routes but don't know where to go, <a href="/en/contact">get in touch with us</a> and let us know what sort of trekking you are looking for. We can provide you with information about various regions, areas where we need exploration, or even specific trails which need to be mapped.</p>
