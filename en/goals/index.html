                <p>In 2016, we will focus on two sections of the TCT: Svaneti (Svaneti to Racha route) and Tusheti (Kazbegi to Omalo route). We will work on building new and improving the existing infrastructure along these routes, mapping and marking the trails, highlighting the cultural sites as well as engaging with local communities to build their support for the project. We are also planning to carry out consultations with local partners to assess how the trail development and the growth in tourism in these two regions can best support the local people in benefitting from it.</p>

                <p>We believe that the ambitious goals listed below are achievable, depending on the funds raised in the next few months.</p>

                <p>The goals for 2016 are:</p>

                <ul>

                    <li>Trail maintenance teams are trained by September</li>
                    <li>Svaneti to Racha is mapped and marked (installation of signs, bridges, blazes, some plant removal, erosion control), all access trails are mapped by October </li>
                    <li>Kazbegi to Omalo is mapped and marked (installation of signs, bridges, blazes, some plant removal, erosion control), all access trails are mapped by October </li>
                    <li>Official TCT guide for Svaneti-Racha and Kazbegi-Omalo is completed by end of 2016</li>
