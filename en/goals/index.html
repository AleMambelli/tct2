                <p>In 2016, we focused on building the first section of the TCT in Svaneti, in the north-west of Georgia. We also scouted the Lesser Caucasus in southern Georgia and in Armenia. In Svaneti, we ran volunteer camps and worked on building new and improving the existing infrastructure along this route, mapping and marking the trails, highlighting the cultural sites as well as engaging with local communities to build their support for the project. <a href="http://transcaucasiantrail.org/en/blog/awesome-things-we-did-in-2016">Click here to read more about what we did in 2016</a>.</p>

                <!--<h3>2017:</h3>-->

                <p>The goals for 2017 are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Svaneti section of the TCT is now open to hike. We will produce a basic guide to the TCT in Svaneti (GPS routes, with basic trail descriptions) and make it available on our website before the 2017 hiking season starts (late Spring).</li>
                    <li>We will expand our volunteer programme and run more camps this summer, in both Georgia and Armenia. We will be posting updates on that soon through this website and on the TCT social media.</li>
                    <li>We will keep consulting the local communities along the trail, and engaging them in trail development. We plan to engage a larger group of local stakeholders and volunteers, and start building networks and knowledge in Azerbaijan and Abkhazia.</li>
                </ul>

                </br>
                <h1>Our Impact</h1>

                <p>We believe that our activities will lead to many positive changes in the Caucasus region, such as:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Greater protection and conservation of the regionâ€™s diverse cultural and natural heritage through greater recognition of and improved access to it for local and international hikers</li>
                    <li>Increased economic opportunities for local communities, poverty reduction and better quality of life</li>
                    <li>More empowered and cohesive local communities, able to effectively respond to the growth in tourism and benefit from it sustainably (mitigating negative impact on other people and the environment)</li>
                    <li>Long-term positive impact on the planet's environment through greater environmental awareness of the local population, their adoption of more sustainable behaviour and improved tourism services provided in a way that minimizes environmental impacts</li>
                    <li>Improved professional skills, self-esteem and better employment opportunities for young people through volunteering and training camps</li>
                    <li>Improved cross-border cooperation that contributes to the stability in the region</li>
                </ul>
