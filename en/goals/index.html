                <p>In 2016, we will focus on two sections of the TCT: Svaneti (Svaneti to Racha route) and Tusheti (Kazbegi to Omalo route). We will work on building new and improving the existing infrastructure along these routes, mapping and marking the trails, highlighting the cultural sites as well as engaging with local communities to build their support for the project. We are also planning to carry out consultations with local partners to assess how the trail development and the growth in tourism in these two regions can best support the local people in benefitting from it.</p>

                <p>We believe that the ambitious goals listed below are achievable, depending on the funds raised in the next few months.</p>

                <p>The goals for 2016 are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>All communities along the trail have been consulted and engaged in trail development by July</li>
                    <li>Trail maintenance teams are trained by September</li>
                    <li>Svaneti to Racha is mapped and marked (installation of signs, bridges, blazes, some plant removal, erosion control), all access trails are mapped by October </li>
                    <li>Official TCT guide for Svaneti-Racha is completed by end of 2016</li>
                    <li>Consultations with local partners to assess the needs of the local people and ways to support them in the development of sustainable tourism started by October</li>
                    <li>Routes for Kakheti, Abkhazia, and entire Southern Route are scouted for trail building in 2017 </li>
                </ul>

                </br>
                <h1>Our Impact</h1>

                <p>We believe that our activities will lead to many positive changes in the Caucasus region, such as:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Greater protection and conservation of the regionâ€™s diverse cultural and natural heritage through greater recognition of and improved access to it for local and international hikers</li>
                    <li>Increased economic opportunities for local communities, poverty reduction and better quality of life</li>
                    <li>More empowered and cohesive local communities, able to effectively respond to the growth in tourism and benefit from it sustainably (mitigating negative impact on other people and the environment)</li>
                    <li>Long-term positive impact on the planet's environment through greater environmental awareness of the local population, their adoption of more sustainable behaviour and improved tourism services provided in a way that minimizes environmental impacts</li>
                    <li>Improved professional skills, self-esteem and better employment opportunities for young people through volunteering and training camps</li>
                    <li>Improved cross-border cooperation that contributes to the stability in the region</li>
                </ul>
